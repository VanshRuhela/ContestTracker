As you may be aware, I am scheduled to join your team through a rotation. I would like to inform you that I had previously arranged a visit home for the last week of March, coinciding with the Holi festival. This plan was made approximately two months ago, and I have already discussed it with my current manager. Therefore, during the initial days of my transition to your team, I kindly request to work from home for a few days. I assure you that during this period, I will maintain full collaboration with the team and remain fully functional while working remotely.
