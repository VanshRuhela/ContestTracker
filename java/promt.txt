First create the dataIteam1 as an entity mapped to a table and repository. The dataIteam contains data1 , data2 , data3 , data4.
data1,data2 creates the composite key for the entitiy. Use @Id for data1 and data2.
data3 is a date, data4 is someother data.

I have another dataIteam2. It contians data1,data2,date3,data4.
For this entitiy it has the same data1 and data2 as composite key as it for dataIteam1.

Create some sample list out of the above dataIteam entity call it dataItemList.

From the dataIteamList now seperate the  sample dataIteamList based on the date field which is data3 for dataIteam1. Create a map  , where the key is a random string and the value is a list of data where the dataIteamList's data3 date is same for all. Call this map groupedByDateMap.

From the groupedByDate create a new list of datatype dataIteam2 which only contains the composite key values as defined above, some other data and the random  generated string.
